#coin changer kata. write a function that takes a number of cents, and that returns a hash the least number of coins needed to generate the value of cents. eg if you have 11 cents you should return {:dime => 1, :penny =?1}; if you have 31 cents you should return {:quarter =>1, :nickel =>1, :penny => 1}
#build up your coin_changer using tests. commit to git after every test
